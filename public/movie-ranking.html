<h1>The Best Movies According to Luca</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Klaus</h3>
<p>
    It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness,<br />
    featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and<br />
    a clever plot. In the sea of generic Christmas movies that get churned<br />
    out each holiday season, Klaus stands out because it tried something<br />
    different and it succeeded.<br />
</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>
    Shutter Island is one of Martin Scorsese's most unique films that not<br />
    only showcases Leonardo DiCaprio's highly versatile acting skills but<br />
    a very well-made psychological thriller with ambiguous scenarios that<br />
    keep the viewers' minds fixated on the possible outcomes of almost every<br />
    scene that transpires throughout the film.<br />
</p>
<h3>Brokeback Mountain</h3>
<p>
    "Brokeback Mountain" lives up to its expectations by being a highly<br />
    homoerotic love story between two cowboys working as ranch hands for<br />
    a winter and the spiral that follows. Lead tremendously by Heath Ledger<br />
    and Jake Gyllenhaal, the film is unforgettable because of the performances<br />
    turned in between the two.<br />
